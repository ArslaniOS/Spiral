#Project Overview
This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability. The goal is to build a flexible solution that can be extended as the project grows. The approach was designed to keep the code well-structured while focusing on providing a clean authentication flow.

#Key Features
1. Scalable Architecture
MVVM Architecture: The project is structured using the MVVM design pattern to separate the UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model). This structure ensures that the code remains modular, easy to test, and easy to extend as new features are added.

ViewModel: Acts as the middle layer between the View (UI) and the Model (data layer), making it easier to manage state, data transformations, and validation logic.

2. Custom Gradient Function
For the Auth Design, a custom gradient function was implemented to provide a consistent background color scheme across the app. This was done to simplify managing the background design, which otherwise could require complex image management.

This custom function creates a smooth gradient transition between colors, helping maintain design consistency with minimal manual management of images.

3. Validation Helper Class
The Validation Helper Class manages common validation checks, such as verifying email format, ensuring passwords are strong, and checking for nil values.

The AuthViewModel leverages this helper class to keep the logic separate from the UI, which ensures that the code is testable and easy to maintain.

4. Authentication Flow
The AuthViewModel is the core part of the authentication process, acting as the mediator between the UI and validation logic.

Touch ID functionality has been integrated for sign-in, enhancing security and user experience.

5. Home and Profile View
Upon successful sign-in, the Home View is displayed, which uses a ViewModel and Data Wrapper to handle mock data and UI state.

A modular approach allows different UI components to be added or replaced easily. The profile data can be viewed and edited through a dedicated Profile Edit screen, though the actual profile data isn't displayed in this version.

6. Custom Navigation System
A custom Root Navigation Class is implemented to handle navigation and pop-up screens. This ensures that the appâ€™s navigation flow is flexible and easy to manage.
Limitations & Future Enhancements
Limitations:
Registration Form: Due to time constraints, the registration functionality has not been implemented. Future versions will include a registration form.

Profile Data: Profile data viewing and editing are not fully implemented yet. The current version focuses on authentication and the home screen.

Test Coverage: The code is structured to be testable, but further unit tests and UI tests will be added in future releases.

Future Enhancements:
User Registration: Future updates will include a registration form with email/password authentication and validation.

Profile Management: Full profile management functionality will be added, allowing users to view and edit their profiles.

Enhanced Security: Features such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and OAuth integration will be considered for improved security.

Backend Integration: Mock data handling will eventually be replaced with real backend integration when an API is available.

Conclusion
This project follows best practices to ensure the app remains maintainable, scalable, and testable. The focus is on delivering a smooth and secure user authentication flow, with room for growth as more features are needed. The modular architecture lays the groundwork for easy expansion and future improvements.
